        <p>
          Sourcehut is the home to some of the most talented software engineers
          in the world. Free and open-source software is eating the world, and
          we have front-line engineers with knowledge and connections to the
          free software community. We offer our services as a consultants
          focusing exclusively on free software projects.
        </p>
        <p>Why should you hire our engineers?</p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <strong>We live and breathe free and open-source software like no
            one else does.</strong><br />
            We have an intimate and practical understanding of the free
            software ecosystem. Our engineers publish and contribute to
            open-source code every day.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>We solve hard problems first.</strong><br />
            We are good at quickly identifying the hard parts of a problem, and
            tackle these first. Our services don't come cheap, so we spend our
            time where it matters most.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>We pull solutions from across domains.</strong><br />
            By encouraging them to work on any projects they like, our engineers
            have a very broad skillset, from low-level graphics drivers to
            high-level ops &amp; monitoring work.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>We are used to hitting the ground running.</strong><br />
            Our engineers are constantly introducing ourselves to new projects.
            We're not afraid to dive into any level of our stack and start
            writing patches.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>We elevate the rest of your team.</strong><br />
            In our role as free software maintainers, mentorship and onboarding
            is a critical part of our work. We can efficiently coordinate teams
            of mixed experience.
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          Whether you have a greenfield project to develop or need someone to
          lead the charge upstream for changes you need to a free software
          project, we're the experts you need.
        </p>
        <h2>What we need from you</h2>
        <p>We have a few requirements for projects we work with:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <strong>The output should be 100% free software</strong>, as
            defined by the <a
              href="https://www.gnu.org/licenses/license-list.html"
            >Free Software Foundation</a>. The code we write for you has to be
            published with a free or open source software license.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>The work should be conducted in public</strong>, on public
            issue trackers, mailing lists, and so on. We don't sign
            non-disclosure agreements, and we frequently welcome outside
            collaborators who express interest in the project.
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p>

          us an email.</a>
        </p>

        <h2>Our engineering ethos</h2>
        <p>
          Each of our engineers spends most of their time working on
          self-directed free software work, both maintaining projects and
          contributing to the ecosystem as a whole. Some of this work is on the
          product you know &mdash; our code forge &mdash; but well over half of
          our time is spent working with the broader ecosystem on a variety of
          goals.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our mission statement isn't "to build a great code forge", but
          "to support and elevate the free software ecosystem." Very often, this
          means working on projects with no immediate value-add to the code
          forge product, which keeps our engineers involved in the community as
          valued contributors to various projects. Our engineers are the
          maintainers of and core contributors to many important projects in
          free software.
        </p>

        <h2>Our process</h2>
        <p>
          Our engineers choose their own projects, and generally only accept
          consulting work part-time. As a rule of thumb, we usually start
          charging a higher rate for more than 2 days per week of committment.
          Once your project has been accepted, we will provide support
          resources from our engineering network, pulling in other engineers if
          necessary, reviewing code and assumptions, and lending assistance
          with planning, execution, and logistics. We also handle billing and
          price negotiation.
        </p>

        <h2>Our engineers</h2>
        <p>
          Most of our engineers publish monthly "status update" articles on
          their websites, which go into detail on what they're working on at
          the moment. Check these out if you want to know more about an
          individual's experience or style.
