title: Reaching the Sourcehut community
---

Keeping up with the community of hackers working on and with Sourcehut.

## Mailing lists

The [sr.ht-discuss](https://lists.sr.ht/~sircmpwn/sr.ht-discuss) mailing list is
used for general Sourcehut-related questions and discussions, sharing your
projects, and so on. The [sr.ht-dev](https://lists.sr.ht/~sircmpwn/sr.ht-dev)
list is used for discussing the development of Sourcehut itself.

## Real time chat

We use [IRC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IRC) for chat. You can join us on
[Freenode](https://freenode.net/) with your favorite IRC client at
[#sr.ht](irc://irc.freenode.net/#sr.ht), or on the web with [this
link](http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=%23sr.ht&uio=d4). There's not
always someone online, so be prepared to send a follow-up email if necessary.
