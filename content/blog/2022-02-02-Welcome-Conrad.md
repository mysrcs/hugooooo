I'm pleased to introduce the SourceHut community to Conrad Hoffmann, aka
bitfehler, who joins us this month as SourceHut's third full-time FOSS
developer. Like the rest of our full-time staff, Conrad's role is to do
self-directed work to "make FOSS better" per the mission of SourceHut, and in
addition to working on the forge, Conrad will be working with many FOSS projects
in the community, including projects on SourceHut and in the FOSS ecosystem as a
whole.

Conrad is a Berliner whose introduction to FOSS came from his experience with
SUSE Linux during his mandatory military service. He fell in love and started
contributing to projects like KDE and heading down a career path which brought
him deeper into Linux and the FOSS ecosystem, learning to use (and enjoy) the C
programming language in particular. Conrad's last job was at SoundCloud, where
he contributed to HAProxy and bore witness to the birth of [Prometheus][0],
which eventually became the basis for [SourceHut's own monitoring at
metrics.sr.ht][1].

In his role at SourceHut, Conrad will keep maintaining his Prometheus exporters
and will branch out into a number of new interest areas. His experience with
ops and infrastructure is something we're hoping to utilize when setting up the
European datacenter, and he's also interested in joining the community efforts
towards building a SourceHut DNS service. We can also expect some interesting
things from Conrad in the Pine64 and OpenStreetMap communities, both of which
have received funding and support from SourceHut in the past. He also intends to
make a difference at a local level as his newborn daughter grows up in a society
run by commercial proprietary software by advocating for the adoption of FOSS in
schools and other places in his community.

I am very pleased to have Conrad on board at SourceHut, and I'm looking forward
to working with him. I hope that you, members of the SourceHut community, will
offer him your welcome as well as he begins to work on projects on SourceHut and
in the broader FOSS ecosystem. He invites you to reach out and get to know him:

Please say hello! Welcome to SourceHut, Conrad!
