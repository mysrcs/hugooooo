SourceHut has been a proud user of the Freenode IRC network since its inception.
Today we have five sr.ht-related IRC channels for end-user support, operational
monitoring, staff coordination, and more.

We will be moving our channels to [Libera Chat][0], effective today.  You can
connect at irc.libera.chat on port 6697 (with SSL) and join us in \#sr.ht.

The Freenode network we once loved is the victim of a hostile takeover by
corporate interests. We entirely reject the illegitimate new leaders who have
used legal threats and back-room deals to steal the network. The dedicated
volunteers at the heart of Freenode's success &mdash; the staff &mdash; have
left for Libera Chat. We are sad to hear news of Freenode's fall, but proud to
be following them, our friends and colleagues, to this new network.

I'll see you there!

**Update 2021-05-25**: The new staff at Freenode have been re-opening channels
which moved to Libera.chat, including #sr.ht. I have re-closed this channel and
will re-iterate in no uncertain terms that sourcehut has left Freenode for good.
Any channels you see on Freenode which proport to represent sourcehut are not
endorsed by this organization.
