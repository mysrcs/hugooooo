title: What's cooking on SourceHut? March 2022

Today we celebrate another 487 new members who've joined since our last update,
bringing our community to 27,896 users in total. As always, I'm relying on you
to be patient with them as they learn the ropes and to make sure they feel
welcome here. This month saw many improvements, but much of them were internal
changes or bug fixes, so this update will be somewhat short.

The Mumble meeting for this month is again cancelled, as the call for agenda
items returned no answers. Going forward, we will set up meetings only for
specific discussions, such as future discussions on billing changes for the
alpha to beta transition.

## General News
