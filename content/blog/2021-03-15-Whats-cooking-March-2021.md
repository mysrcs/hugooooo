Hi! Another month of development has passed, and I'm here to fill you in on
what's new. Another 686 signups this month has brought us to 21,041 users. As
always, I'll be counting on you to make the new users feel at home, please be
patient with them and help them learn the ropes.

Last month, something suddenly came up and I had to skip the monthly Mumble call
unannounced &mdash; my apologies! We'll be holding the meeting as scheduled
tomorrow at 16:00 UTC at voice.mnus.de, port 64738, in the sourcehut room.

## pages.sr.ht

The big news this month is that we shipped [sourcehut pages][0], which provides
static hosting for websites and Gemini capsules. 282 users have created a site
with it so far &mdash; you should check it out, too! Getting a website published
only takes a couple of minutes.

## todo.sr.ht

todo.sr.ht's initial GraphQL API is now available. Check out the
[playground](https://todo.sr.ht/graphql) here and our [GraphQL
docs](https://man.sr.ht/graphql.md) if you're not already familiar with how it
works.

Next up is...

## builds.sr.ht

The GraphQL API for builds.sr.ht is now underway. This one is quite welcome, as
builds.sr.ht is our oldest sr.ht API and the most in need of an upgrade. It will
also give us some opportunities to improve security for builds.

## Project hub

A minor update for the project hub this month: popular tags are now shown on the
[public index](https://sr.ht/projects).
