[PeerTube][peertube] is an excellent project which aims to create an open and
decentralized video "tube" for hosting video content with distributed governance
and community-driven development. Chochobuzz, with the help of dozens of
contributors, has put in the hard engineering work to build a great platform,
and now we want to see it filled with content.

To help make this happen, **SourceHut is committing $5,000 to bootstrap content
on the PeerTube network**. This money will be used to help new content creators
start making videos for PeerTube. We'll pay for some equipment to get you
started: cameras, microphones, video capture cards, and so on, whatever is
appropriate for the kind of videos you intend to make, plus a $200 budget to
spend at your discretion on the first few videos. Need a nice camera? A couple
of nice microphones for conducting interviews? A drone for capturing footage?
Let's make it happen. You'll also be set up on [Liberapay][lp] so that your
audience can help you build a sustainable lifestyle.

If you have an interesting hobby to share, in-depth knowledge on a subject to
teach, or a talent you'd like to show off, or a great idea we haven't thought
of, please send an email to [sir@cmpwn.com](mailto:sir@cmpwn.com) with the
subject line "PeerTube bootstrap application: &lt;your name&gt;". Include a
short summary of who you are and why you want to apply, and details on what
kinds of videos you'd like to make. Tell us why open culture is important to
you.

The following conditions apply:

- You must not already be regularly publishing content on another platform.
  We're looking to fund new content creators, not existing ones.[^1]
- You can only upload videos to PeerTube - not to YouTube or anywhere else.
- Your videos must be use a [Creative Commons][cc] license, like
  [CC-BY-NC-SA][cc-by-nc-sa].
- We expect you to make at least 5 videos. If you decide video creation isn't
  for you after that, we'll take the equipment back and you'll be off the hook.
- Once you start earning at least $20/month on Liberapay, we'll split the
  ongoing cost of hosting evenly among all creators: currently $45/mo. You will
  never be expected to pay more than 25% of your Liberapay income; SourceHut
  will cover the rest.

[^1]: If you've already made a few videos on the side, that's fine - be sure to let us know in your application, and we'll exercise discretion.

Our instance is at [spacepub.space][spacepub]. We'll handle the technical
administration of the server and set you up with the resources you need to get
started, and together we'll create a community of open-culture creators who
support one another to produce a vibrant commons.  Let's help make PeerTube a
great platform!
