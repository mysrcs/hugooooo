In summary, Sourcehut is financially healthy, with an operating monthly profit
of about $1,038. Slowed growth in Q2 picked back up in Q3, to levels similar to
Q1. Though perpetual growth is not a goal of Sourcehut, growth does help us
accomplish our goals. One of these goals is to sponsor members of the
open-source community to work on self-directed projects - a goal which was met
for Q4, when Simon Ser will be joining us. My goals for future growth are:

- Investing in additional hardware and resources
- Marketing & outreach
- Investing in the broader open-source ecosystem

Thank you for your support in the alpha. I'm looking forward to continuing to
serve you.

## Revenue sources

Sourcehut receives revenue from paid user subscriptions. During Q1, we processed
1,134 invoices. The invoices paid break down as:

    612     $2  (paid monthly)
    282     $5  (paid monthly)
    65      $10 (paid monthly)
    121     $2  (paid yearly)
    43      $5  (paid yearly)
    11      $10 (paid yearly)

The total gross revenue during this period was $9,172.00, which after
transaction fees comes out to $8,511.83. This is an improvement over Q2, but
falls just short of Q1 revenue. In Q3, 1,650 new users registered accounts, of
which 204 (12%) have paid for their account. As of the end of Q3, there were
10,331 registered users in total, of which 1,272 (12.3%) have paid
subscriptions.

At time of writing (2 weeks into Q4), the breakdown of subscription types is as
follows:

    223     $2  (paid monthly)
    104     $5  (paid monthly)
    26      $10 (paid monthly)
    582     $2  (paid yearly)
    174     $5  (paid yearly)
    62      $10 (paid yearly)

The monthly revenue from these subscriptions (with annual subscriptions realized
over 12 months) is approximately $3,307, after transaction fees. This is a $734
increase in monthly revenue compared to Q2.

Sourcehut has $10,748 in the bank at the time of writing (2019-10-21).

Breakdown of Q3 expenses:

    $1950    Philadelphia datacenter lease (inc. network, power, etc)
    $1693    New server equipment
    $ 360    Contractor payments (artwork)
    $ 129    San Francisco datacenter lease (inc. network, power, etc)
    $ 107    Misc
    $  95    Research expenses (names.sr.ht)

Payroll:

     $1,500.00   Drew DeVault (CEO)
    +$  179.07   Employer taxes & processing fees

Going into Q4, our monthly expenses are expected to be:

    $1500/mo    Payroll (approximate)
    $640.00/mo  Philadelphia datacenter lease
    $129/qtr    San Francisco datacenter lease

Starting in Q4, Sourcehut will be sponsoring the work of free software developer
Simon Ser, which is being recorded under Payroll for these quarterly financial
reports. To protect his privacy, I have adjusted my personal salary and summed
payroll into a single figure. This figure will continue to be opaque until a few
more hires are made, after which I will resume disclosure of my personal salary.

The closure of Q4 will mark one year of Sourcehut's public alpha.  Accordingly,
yearly subscriptions will be renewing for the first time.  What fraction of
these subscriptions will bounce, be cancelled, or refunded will have a
significant impact our financial planning, and is the biggest financial unknown
we face leading into Q4. We're planning a light marketing drive to remind our
subscribers of what we've accomplished in 2019, and what we're planning going
into 2020.
