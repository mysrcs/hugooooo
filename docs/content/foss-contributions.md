SourceHut employs a staff with an extensive background in free software
philosophy and practice, and we routinely contribute to thousands of free
software projects around the ecosystem. We write exclusively free software at
SourceHut. This page summarizes some of our work in the broader ecosystem.

## SourceHut is free software

The SourceHut platform is itself free software. You can browse the source code

## Projects maintained by SourceHut staff

Free software projects primarily developed and maintained by SourceHut staff:

[Ares](https://ares-os.org), based on the Helios micro-kernel, is a research
operating system designed and implemented by SourceHut staff using the Hare
programming language.

### The Hare programming language

[Hare](https://harelang.org) is a systems programming language designed to be
simple, stable, and robust. Hare uses a static type system, manual memory
management, and a minimal runtime. It is well-suited to writing operating
systems, system tools, compilers, networking software, and other low-level, high
performance tasks.

We design, develop, and maintain the Hare programming language in collaboration
with the broader Hare community. We also maintain a number of Hare libraries:

* [hare-compress](https://git.sr.ht/~sircmpwn/hare-compress): Compression algorithms for Hare
* [hare-ev](https://git.sr.ht/~sircmpwn/hare-ev): Event loop for Hare
