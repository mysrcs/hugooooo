Hallo uit Nederland! Today's "What's cooking" is brought to you from Amsterdam,
where I moved to at the start of the week. Due to this, I have had less time
available for work, but there has been some new progress regardless. User
signups haven't slowed, for one: we now have 23,670 users, some 442 greater than
June. Please show them your hospitality and help them learn about sourcehut!

The usual Mumble meeting for this month is, sadly, cancelled. I do not have the
necessary equipment to participate yet. I'll see you for the August meeting
instead.

The only substantial improvement this month has been in lists.sr.ht, though it
is not yet visible: the GraphQL API. I had hoped to ship it earlier, but it will
be delayed for perhaps another week or two due to issues moving abroad. Progress
has been significant in any case, and it is almost complete.

Outside of this, various small bug fixes and maintenance work has landed
throughout the services. Once I'm settled into my new home, I expect progress to
resume at a normal pace.
