For those looking for a new host, Sourcehut may be a good choice for you.
Unlike its closed-source competitors, Sourcehut is [100% open source
software][srht-source], and thanks to the Mercurial community (especially
Ludovic Chabant), Hg support on Sourcehut is strong and will remain so for as
long as the Hg community is committed to it.

Bitbucket users may find our workflow different from what they're used to, but
it's different for good reasons. Give it an shot and ask for help if you need
it. We've prepared [a migration tool](https://hg.sr.ht/%7Esircmpwn/invertbucket)
which will import your Bitbucket repos and issues.
