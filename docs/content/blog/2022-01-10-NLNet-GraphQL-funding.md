I'm pleased to share that SourceHut has been selected by [NLNet] to receive
funding as part of the [NGI Zero: Search & Discovery] fund for the purpose of
completing API 2.0, our GraphQL API development. NLNet is providing monetary
support to SourceHut contributor Adnan Maolood, aka [~adnano], who has agreed to
work full-time to help with our API 2.0 efforts over the course of this year.

The NLNet Foundation is a Dutch organization which provides funding to various
projects which promote open and secure digital infrastructure, and has provided
funding for [hundreds of free and open-source projects][projects], many of which
you rely on every day, and some of which rely on SourceHut! Prior recipients of
NLNet funding include projects like Tor, WireGuard, postmarketOS, Jitsi, and
more, and I'm proud to see SourceHut join them.

API 2.0 is one of the major outstanding tasks between us and the completion of
the SourceHut beta. We can look forward to much better access to SourceHut's
internals, a more robust implementation, and a simpler deployment system for
third-party SourceHut installations. We'll be building upon this work to develop
alternative frontends, such as the [hut] CLI tool and a new [Gemini]-based
frontend. This also paves the way for many other features which we're cooking
up, including user groups/organizations, better data autonomy tools for import &
export and account deletion & renaming, and future plans like names.sr.ht's DNS
hosting and domain registration services. Exciting stuff!

I'm excited for this initative, and I'm glad to have Adnan on board to help. Big
thanks to NLNet for agreeing to sponsor his work! Let's get this beta done.
