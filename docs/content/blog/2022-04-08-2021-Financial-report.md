title: SourceHut's 2021 Financial report

In summary, SourceHut is financially healthy, profitable, and growing. We
enjoyed substantial YoY growth between 2020 and 2021. SourceHut hired its third
full-time software engineer, and with the help of the [NGI0 Discovery fund][0]
we had another developer join us to help with the GraphQL development work. We
have a sustainable business model and sufficient capital with which to execute
all of our planned expansions, such as a new European datacenter presence.

We had previously published public financial reports quarterly, but preparing
such reports is a time-consuming process, particularly given the growing
complexity of our finances. Starting with this report, and going forward, we
will publish reports annually. The exact format of these reports and the ability
to compare numbers across years will be somewhat inconsistent as we gradually
move our business operations into Europe.

## 2021 revenue sources

SourceHut has two main revenue streams:

1. Paid subscriptions for the forge platform, which are generally consistent
2. Contracts via our [consulting arm], which are generally more inconsistent

[consulting arm]: https://sourcehut.org/consultancy/

We use the forge platform revenue as the basis for our planning and treat
consulting revenue as capital to fund new projects.

### Platform revenue

We issued 10,484 invoices to SourceHut subscribers in 2021. Subscriptions are
available at three price points: $2, $5, and $10; billed monthly, or annually
for a 2 month discount. Invoices paid in 2021 break down as follows:

```
5,153   $ 2   (paid monthly)
2,098   $ 5   (paid monthly)
  818   $10   (paid monthly)
1,672   $ 2   (paid yearly)
  496   $ 5   (paid yearly)
  184   $10   (paid yearly)
```

The total revenue from platform subscriptions in 2021 was $105,777.08, which,
after credit card processing fees, was $98,741.95. This is an increase of 35%
over 2020. In 2021, a total of 7,184 new users signed up for an account. Of
these users, 956 signed up for a paid account. Of these 956, 45 are currently
delinquent. This is a conversion rate of 12.6%, slightly improved from 2020's
11.7%. Among all users registered in all years (a total of 28,262 at the time of
writing), 11.35% (or 3,209 users) have paid accounts.

This modest increase may be at least somewhat explained by the introduction of
paid-only services such as builds.sr.ht and chat.sr.ht in 2021. Note that,
following the completion of the alpha, all users who own resources (such as
repositories, bug trackers, mailing lists, etc) will be expected to move to a
paid account. Contributors will not be expected to pay, and users who wish to
pay but cannot will be offered financial aid.

On the subject of financial aid, at the time of writing, 59 users have received
financial aid. 100% of users who requested financial aid received it. Reasons
provided by users include, in descending order of frequency:

- Inability to pay due to financial constraints
- Lack of support for their preferred payment method
- Political sanctions due to the situation in Ukraine and Russia

### Consulting revenue

SourceHut accepts consulting projects at the discretion of our full-time
engineers, part-time. These contracts are executed in public and are required to
only produce free and open source software.

In total, SourceHut received $285,739 in revenue from consulting engagements in
2021.

### Summary of revenue

Our total revenue from all sources for 2021, before taxes, expenses, and fees,
was $391,516.

### Cash on hand

At the close of the year, we had $102,402 in cash on hand.

## 2021 expenses

In 2021 we had the following expenses, excluding payroll:

```
$8,277    Colocation costs (space, power, network)
$7,035    Credit card processing fees
$2,125    Sponsorships
$1,110    Domain names
$  995    Miscellaneous
$  570    Insurance
```

We cancelled our GitHub sponsorships partway through the year, and began
sponsoring the OpenStreetMap project as a Bronze sponsor.

From 2022 forward, we use a standard approach to compensation. Each full-time
SourceHut engineer earns $2,500 per month for self-directed work furthering our
mission to "make free software better" at their own discretion; working on
projects like the forge but also maintaining independently directed projects and
contributing to the broader ecosystem. Additionally, SourceHut engineers can
elect to, at their discretion, participate part-time (generally no more than two
days per week) on consulting projects. Furthermore, my compensation as CEO was
dealt with separately &mdash; previously I made a bit less than everyone else,
and going forward I will also be paid the standard compensation.

In 2021, our compensation scheme was not standardized, and varied throughout the
year. We also had three special personnel arrangements in 2021: one paid intern,
one short-term, part-time contractor to help with a specific internal project,
and one medium-term, part-time contractor to help with a specific consulting
engagement. For privacy reasons, and due to the complexity of the situation, we
will report our compensation figures in aggregate. In 2022, we will break this
figure down further for transparency.

Not including my compensation as CEO, we paid a total of $131,597 between all
forms of staff compensation.

Thus, our total expenses for 2021 were $151,459.

## Expectations for 2022

We have three full-time staff paid under the standard compensation model, and
about $700/mo in recurring expenses. Currently we make about $9200/mo from the
platform, putting our monthly profit at about $1000, without factoring in
consulting revenue. Thus, the platform provides for a sustainable business
independently of our other lines of business. The breakdown of active
subscriptions at the time of writing is as follows:

```
$2    monthly   518 users
$5    monthly   210 users
$10   monthly    80 users
$2    yearly  1,710 users
$5    yearly    500 users
$10   yearly    190 users
```

We have three ongoing consulting contracts which we expect to continue through
most of the year. We have already migrated or established some of these
contracts with the new Dutch business entity, and we intend to migrate more of
our business over the Atlantic throughout 2022.

At the time of writing, SourceHut has $62,608 and â‚¬30,590 in cash on hand.

The only major investment we have planned is the deployment of a European
datacenter presence, which is likely to begin in late 2022, but may be delayed
to early 2023.

## Conclusion

In short, SourceHut is profitable and is comfortably succeeding in its efforts
to provide sustainable software development & infrastructure for the free and
open source software community. We remain committed to investing 100% of our
profit into the free and open source community. I want to extend my thanks to
the SourceHut community for its role in achieving our goals: sincerely, thank
you.
